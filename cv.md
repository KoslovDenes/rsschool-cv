## About me
I have been working as a product manager (not really) in food delivery for 2 years now. I create beautiful and functional tables in Google Sheets. I want to improve my knowledge and become a developer. Decided to start with the frontend.  

## Code example
```
function myFunction(n, s) {         
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
       sum = sum + s;
    }
    console.log(sum);
}
```
